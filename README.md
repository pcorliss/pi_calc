# Calculating Pi

I recently watched this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvimAM_SLic) explaining how to calculate Pi with only a random number generator. It was a clever implementation. I'm not sure I would have been able to solve it on the spot but it did leave me wondering. Why do you need the random number generator at all. Surely you could generate points on a grid evenly spaced and apply the same method and get a similar result.

So I put together some code quickly to test it out. There's no appreciable difference from what I can see. Perhaps the random number generator is just a red-herring?
